History features:
 
1. I want each user to see there own history only not others. 
Solution: create a new database for the system (not the one that the user uploaded),
it should contain table for the users of the system and table for the history.
Cols of users table: userID, first name, last name, email.
Cols of history table: userID, prmopt, sql.


2. I want to save the question that the user wants not everything.
Solution: add boolean save.

3. CRUD operations.

In each of these features, we should handle the edge cases.

Note for the future: in the frontend there will be a sidebar for the history, to diffrentiate between the questions we should
give a title for each question between 3-6 words. When the user clicks on it, the question should appear in the terminal, the sql
appears in the proper place, and the user can run it to see the result.
